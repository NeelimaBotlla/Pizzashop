For the successful setup of the application (Windows):

 1. Download and install the latest POSTGRE SQL from "https://www.postgresql.org/download/" and select the respective OS(Windows) for your machine and
    create a database with any name (This requires an extra change in the application which is explained at the end of this file) or simply "AMD" with password "mypass",
    then, initialize the database with the script given inside the folder "server" named "AMD_DB.sql".
 
 2. Now, open command prompt
	-> navigate to the the application folder i.e.,using "cd (folder location)\AMDProject\pizzaAMDProject\server"
	-> run "npm install" and click enter.
	-> This installs node_modules in the respective folder. (Warnings can be ignored)
 
 3. Then we can open command prompt again or simply go back to "pizza" folder in the application in the same command prompt and 
    execute the above step-2 for "cd (folder location)\AMDProject\pizzaAMDProject\pizza".

 4. To actually start the application:
	-> Open command prompt and navigate to this path using "cd (folder location)\AMDProject\pizzaAMDProject\server" and run "node index.js".
	-> Open another command prompt and navigate to this path using "cd (folder location)\AMDProject\pizzaAMDProject\pizza and run "npm start". 
		(This directly opens the application frontend on localhost 3000.)
	

Note: The above step-4 starts an express node server and a frontend server required for the application and these servers should be running until we close the application

******

If your database has a different name or password compared to the above details, then change the file named "api.js" accordingly which is located in the server folder of the application.
i.e. password: "(your password here)",
     database: "(your database name here)"
